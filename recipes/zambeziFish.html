      <h3>Amazing Zambezi Baked Fish</h3>
      <p>
        This method is a classic way to cook fish in Zambia and it would
        traditionally be done over hot coals. The fish also tends to be
        freshwater fish and works beautifully with the spices. Fresh water fish
        is a bit of a delicacy and not everyone’s first choice when it comes to
        fish due to the strong flavour.

        <li>Heat your oven to 180ºC</li>
        <li>
          Remove any scales, clean and wash the fish. With a sharp knife make 3
          or 4 slits on the outside of the fish on both sides. Set to one side.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a pestle and mortar crush the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, black
          peppercorns and place into a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chop the curry leaves and add to the bowl with the turmeric, chilli
          powder and methi. Stir in the oil to make a paste.

        <li>Slice the ginger, garlic and chillies.</li>

          Chop the peppers and tomato, slice the onion and mix with the ginger,
          garlic and chillies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Smear some of the spice mix inside the fish and then stuff it with the
          onion mixture. Smear the remaining fish masala all over the outside of
          the fish.

        <li>Place the fish onto some foil and fold it to seal neatly.</li>
        <li>
          Place of a baking sheet and cook for 20-30 minutes until cooked
          through. This can also be cooked on the BBQ for a smoky flavour.

          Once cooked, remove from the oven and open up the parcel with will be
          aromatic and delicious. You can put this under a hot grill for a few
          minutes to crispy up if you want to.
        </li>

          Serve with some cooked rice, a squeeze of lemon juice and a sprinkle
          of coriander. I also like to add a few chilli flakes.
