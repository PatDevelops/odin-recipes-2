        <h3>Directions/Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by washing the Impwa (Garden eggs) in cold water, and removing the green calyx on top</li>
            <li>Cut the Impwa in quarters, the goal is uniformity. For the bigger ones, you can do thirds as well
            </li>
            <li>Pour the oil into the pan and bring to the stove. Add the Impwa in to fry, once hot</li>
            <li>Fry the Impwa for about five minutes, and by then youâ€™ll notice it start to get tender. Season with the flavored salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Next, prepare the other ingredients, slicing the Onion lengthwise. Cut up the Garlic and Basil.
            </li>
            <li>Add the chopped Garlic and onion to the pan first, and saute for about 3 minutes</li>
            <li>Then, add in the rest of the dry seasonings : Paprika and Onion powder (and Chili/Curry, if using), and cook for another couple of minutes. These spices bring a little sweetness to the dish</li>
            <li>In the final step, add in the grated tomato and fresh basil. If your tomato is very juicy, you wonâ€™t need to add any water. If it is not though, proceed to add 2 tablespoons of water. Combine well and cover to cook for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes, the dish is ready! ðŸ˜Š You want the Impwa fully cooked through and tender â€“ But not falling apart</li>
        </ol>
