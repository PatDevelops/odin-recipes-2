      <div class="paragraphs">
        Ultra tender flesh and super crispy skin smothered in a thick savoury
        sauce with vegetables. This Chicken Stew is slow cooked in the oven to
        develop deep, incredible flavours. The smell that fills the house when
        itâ€™s in the oven is simply wonderful!

      <h3 class="headerTwo">Steps/Instructions</h3>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 180C/350F</li>
          <li>
            Heat oil in a large pot over high heat. Brown chicken on both sides
            until light golden, sprinkling with salt and pepper. Remove from
            pot. (Do in 2 batches if pot not big enough)
          </li>
          <li>
            If there's too much oil in the pot, discard some. Add onion and
            garlic. Cook for 2 minutes until onion is translucent. Add carrots
            and celery, cook for 1 minute
          </li>
          <li>
            Add wine. Stir, scraping the bottom of the pan to dissolve the brown
            bits into the liquid. Cook for 1 minute until liquid is mostly gone.
            Sprinkle flour across surface, stir
          </li>
          <li>
            Add broth, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, thyme and bay leaves.
            Stir to dissolve tomato paste. Place chicken on top, keeping the
            skin above the liquid level as much as you can.
          </li>
          <li>Bring to simmer then cover. Bake for 45 minutes.</li>
          <li>
            Remove from oven, remove lid. Add potatoes, pushing them into the
            liquid and rearranging chicken so they sit on top (for lovely crispy
            skin)
          </li>
          <li>
            Return to oven without the lid for a further 40 minutes until the
            chicken skin is deep golden and super crispy, the potatoes are soft
            and the sauce is thickened
          </li>
          <li>Taste sauce and adjust salt and pepper to taste</li>
          <li>
            Serve with warm crusty bread on the side to dunk in the sauce - or
            go all the way with Garlic Bread! Optional: garnish with extra fresh
            thyme leaves or parsley
          </li>
        </ol>
